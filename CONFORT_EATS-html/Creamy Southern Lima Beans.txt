Lima Beans in a Colander for Southern Lima Beans Recipe

Cook the beans:
Place the beans, onion, garlic cloves, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, bay leaf, and turkey wings in a large Dutch oven or pot. 

Add the stock. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. 

Once it starts to boil, decrease the heat to medium-low. Cover with a lid. 

Simmer for up to 2 hours or until the beans are tender to your liking. Make sure to stir the mixture a few times while cooking for a creamier sauce.

Pick the meat from the turkey wings: 
Using tongs, remove the turkey wings and let them cool until you can comfortably handle them. Remove the cooked meat from the bones using a fork and shred; discard the skin. Place the meat back in the pot.

Remove the bay leaf; discard.

Season and serve:
Taste the beans and season with additional salt and pepper, if needed.

Serve warm.
